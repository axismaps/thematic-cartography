# Thematic Cartography Guide

A short, friendly guide to basic principles of thematic mapping.  
https://www.axismaps.com/guide/

This brief overview of basic thematic mapping is adapted from documentation for [indiemapper](http://indiemapper.io) written in 2010 by Axis Maps. It has been edited to remove software-specific content, to add a bit more information here and there, and to update some links. We hope that with further contributions it can expand to include more helpful information and references.
