### Reference maps versus thematic maps

Most maps fall into one of two broad categories:

**Reference maps** are meant to show the locations of various phenomena, such a countries, cities, rivers, etc. Chances are the maps you use most in your daily life are reference maps—street maps (e.g., Google Maps) that help you see _where things are_. Other common reference maps emphasize physical landscapes—think topographic maps or maps of a national park.

**Thematic maps** are meant not simply to show locations, but rather to show _attributes_ or _statistics_ about places, spatial patterns of those attributes, and relationships between places. For example, while a reference map might show the locations of cities, a thematic map might also represent the population of those cities. It's the difference between mapping _places_ and mapping _data_. This site is about thematic maps, describing some of the different types and basic principles.

### Symbolizing data

Genereally speaking, thematic cartography is about symbolizing data in different ways. We do this through the use of several **visual variables** of grahics such as size, color, and shape. The exact way in which data should be symbolized depends on the nature of the data (is it a count of things? is it a categorical description?), as well as the nature of the geography (is it an individual point? is it a large area?). [In these pages](../) we aim to describe some of the common ways to represent thematic map data, along with some tips and best practices.
